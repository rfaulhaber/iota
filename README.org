#+title: iota

~iota~ is the working name of a new text editor. Born out of the desire to bring what's useful about Emacs into the 21st century.

This is very much a work in progress!

~iota~'s overall goals include:
- async first, unlike Emacs
- truly parallel
- fully configurable with Lua and as customizable as Emacs
- buffer-based editing, where buffers have self-contained settings
- controlling buffer behavior with a series of modes
- first-class transients
- support for emacs-like keychording
- workspaces, which contain buffers and cross-buffer settings
- native tree-sitter support and tree-sitter based editing
- native LSP support
- client/server separation. I plan to build and support several first-class implementations but it should be designed such that a user could build their own front-end implementation
- eventually, collaborative editing
